                <articles>
                    <p class="Mar">Pizza Margherita (more commonly known in English as Margherita pizza) is a typical Neapolitan pizza, 
                    made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt and extra-virgin olive oil. 
                    Traditionally, it is made with fior di latte (cow's milk mozzarella) rather than buffalo mozzarella.</p>

                <h3>Capricciosa</h3> 
                <articles>
                    <p class="Cap">Pizza capricciosa (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpittsa kapritˈtʃoːza; -oːsa]) is a style of pizza in Italian cuisine prepared with mozzarella cheese, Italian baked ham, mushroom, artichoke and tomato. Types of edible mushrooms used may include cremini (white mushrooms) and others. Some versions may also use prosciutto (a dry-cured ham), marinated artichoke hearts, olive oil, olives, basil leaves, and egg. Some versions may be prepared using a thin crust. Although it has similar ingredients as pizza quattro stagioni, they are arranged differently.</p>

                <h3>Hawaiian</h3> 
                <articles>
                    <p class="Haw">Greek-Canadian Sam Panopoulos claimed that he created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese dishes which commonly mix sweet and savoury flavours, Panopoulos experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon and other toppings which were not initially very popular. The addition of pineapple to the traditional mix of tomato sauce and cheese, sometimes with ham or sometimes with bacon, soon became popular locally and eventually became a staple offering of pizzerias around the world. Panopoulos chose the name Hawaiian after the brand of canned pineapple they used.</p>
